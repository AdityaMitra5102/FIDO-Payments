# [Seamless web based framework for leveraging digital transactional process](https://payments.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com)

We use FIDO2 technology in this project. FIDO2, a recently evolved technology by FIDO Alliance is on its way to prove itself to be instrumental 
in Passwordless authentication frameworks. However, it can used for much more than just authentication. This project proposes a centralized and secure
system for easy web based money transfer. we use device attestation to eliminate all common scams and fraudulent activities.
We aim to have a partnership with various banks and trusted companies 
It guarantees easy record maintenance and hence the users will not have to go through lengthy processes.

## Objective

The security of e-banking has received attention due to the fraudulent behavior of fraudsters; 
the absence of adequate e-banking security has kept many people away from the service till today. Internet Banking Fraud is a fraud or theft committed 
using online technology to  illegally remove money from a bank account and/or transfer money to an account in a different bank. With the current increase
in popularity of internet banking more people become prone to fall in the traps of cyber criminals.​ Hence, we introduce Pay Easy, which enables FIDO2
via simple API calls across all supported browsers and platforms on billions of devices consumers use every day. FIDO2 cryptographic login credentials are 
unique across every website, biometrics or other secrets like passwords never leave the user’s device and are never stored on a server. This security model
eliminates the risks of phishing, all forms of password theft and replay attacks. 
Because FIDO keys are unique for each Internet site and each user, they cannot be used to track you across sites hence ensure highest level of privacy.​
